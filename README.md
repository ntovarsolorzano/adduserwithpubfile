# adduserwithpubfile
Simple script to add a new user with a given .pub file. It asks you the name of the username you want to create, you have to type a password for that user, and then it asks the content of the .pub file. Once that's done, you should be able to login using SSH, with that username and key file. 

# How to use
Run: 
`wget https://github.com/ntovarsolorzano/adduserwithpubfile/blob/main/newuser.sh; chmod +x newuser.sh; bash newuser.sh`
